# API-Pythons-Homework
A project using API pulled data to observe weather patterns in randomized cities and analyze correlations among a number of variables

This analysis features weather data pulled from OpenWeatherMap API for a total of 624 randomized cities generated from CitiPy.  The data was then put in dataframes with visualizations depicting correlations between various weather variables and geographic data.   Findings were generally what one would expect to see.  Including:
*Latitude and Cloudiness had no correlation
*Latitude and Humidity levels showed a direct correlation
*Latitude and Temperatures have indirect correlation
  *I.E. The higher latitudes have lower maximum temperatures
